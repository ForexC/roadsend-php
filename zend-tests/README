All of this code, including the test program and the test templates, originally came from the 
Zend PHP implementation, freely available at www.php.net under the PHP License.

It has been modified in some cases to take advantage of features in Roadsend PHP that aren't
available in Zend PHP, and to remove tests for some features that aren't implemented in 
Roadsend PHP.
