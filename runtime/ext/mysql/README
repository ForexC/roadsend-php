TEST SUITE INSTRUCTIONS
-----------------------

To run the MySQL test suite, you'll need the following database setup:

1) database server name: dbserver (throw it in /etc/hosts)
          database name: test
              user name: develUser
              pass word: d3v3lpa55

   you can use this to add the user: 
   GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP ON test.* TO develUser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY "d3v3lpa55"
   GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE,DROP ON test.* TO develUser@% IDENTIFIED BY "d3v3lpa55"

(both are needed because of the localhost entry with no username which mysql finds first).

2) create the test tables by running the following command (make sure test db exists first):

   cat schema.sql | mysql -u develUser -pd3v3lpa55 test
